As we may our way around a circle, we can define every point of on the circumference of the circle by drawing a line from the center of the circle to that point, taking the angle of that line. With that angle we can derive the x coordinate :

x coord: xCircleCenter + cos(angle) * radius

y coord: yCircleCenter + sin(angle) * radius

### Degrees and Radians

When talking about units of degrees, most people are more familiar with degrees (0 to 360), but in P5 we use radians. Instead of 0 to 360, in radians, the range is 0 to 2*PI.

Another thing to note is that zero starts at the most right hand point of the circle.
